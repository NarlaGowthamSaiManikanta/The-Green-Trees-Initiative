# Steps to work with this Project
* First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone http/link/to/clone/the/repository
   cd cloned_repository
   ```

* Now you can see there are three HTML files named,
  * Home-page-layout.html
  * Donation-page-layout.html
  * AboutUs-page-layout.html
  
### Now you can see the files by opening them.
